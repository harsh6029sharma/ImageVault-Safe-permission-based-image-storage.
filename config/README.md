# 📸 ImageVault – Secure Role-Based Image Management System

ImageVault is a **secure, role-based image management backend** built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.  
It allows **admins** to upload and delete images, while **users** can only view them.  
Images are uploaded using **Multer** and stored securely in the **Cloudinary cloud storage**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Role-Based Authentication & Authorization** (RBAC) – Only authorized users can perform certain actions.
- ☁️ **Cloud Storage** – Images are uploaded to and retrieved from **Cloudinary**.
- 📤 **Image Upload via Multer** – Efficient and secure image handling.
- 👨‍💼 **Admin Privileges** – Upload and delete images.
- 👥 **User Access** – View images only.
- 🗄 **MongoDB Database** – Stores user credentials, roles, and image metadata.
- 🔑 **JWT Authentication** – Secure login & access token management.
- ⚡ **RESTful API** – Well-structured and easy-to-use endpoints.

## 📸 Image Upload Flow

1. **Admin** logs in with JWT-based authentication.
2. Admin uploads an image via Multer → stored temporarily on server.
3. Image is uploaded to **Cloudinary** via API.
4. Image metadata (URL, public ID, uploader, etc.) is stored in **MongoDB**.
5. Users can **view images** via public endpoint.

---

## 🔒 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* **Admin** – Upload & delete images, view all.
* **User** – View images only.

Middleware ensures routes are **protected** and access is **restricted** based on roles.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* ✅ Add pagination for images
* ✅ Implement image search/filter
* ✅ Add frontend dashboard (React.js)
* ✅ Support multiple image formats and compression
* ✅ Implement unit & integration testing

If you want, I can also **add badges** (like "Made with Node.js", "MongoDB", "JWT Secured") and a **Cloudinary workflow diagram** to make your README even more visually appealing for recruiters. That will make your repo look like a **professional open-source project**.  

Do you want me to enhance it with those visuals?
